# CrowdScout

## Overview

CrowdScout is an app that allows you to view the most recent Instagram videos & images taken at
Foursquare venues in cities around the world. CrowdScout tries to solve a question you may have
asked yourself before: "I wish I knew what that place looked like right now."

As you browse through the available cities, the venues are sorted by the # of people currently
checked into that venue. The more people that are checked in, the better the odds of being able to
see pictures taken from that venue within the last hour. Sometimes, you will even find venues with
pictures coming in mere seconds apart; this happens often at sports arenas, concert halls, and
anywhere that sells beer on weekend nights.

Enjoy!
